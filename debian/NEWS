refpolicy (2:2.20140421-10) unstable; urgency=medium

  Starting with this version, the policy packages support the new libsemanage
  2.4 policy store. The modules shipped by these packages are automatically
  installed with the priority 100. The system administrator can override any
  of these modules by installing them using an higher priority (ie. 400).

  During the update from a previous version, the existing module store is not
  automatically migrated to the new format. All the existing modules and
  configuration files are left untouched on the file system
  (/etc/selinux/{default,mls}/modules/active/store). Any customisation should
  be migrated manually.

  The selinux-policy-dev package is now installing the headers and Makefile
  under /usr/share/selinux/devel instead of /usr/share/selinux/{default,mls}.
  If you are bulding custom modules, be sure you are pointing to this new
  location.

refpolicy (2:2.20131214-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Starting with this version, the modules will be automatically updated with
  each package upgrade. Modules that have previously been removed (semodule -r)
  will now be re-installed on upgrade, if you want to permanantly prevent a
  module from being loaded you must disable it with the "semodule -d" command.

  Also a lot of modules have been changed in the release, to ensure all the
  files are properly labeled on disk, you should force a full relabel by
  running the following command: "touch /.autorelabel" and then rebooting.

  * I've documented the process of upgrading a SE Linux system to Lenny at
    the above URL.  But I'll summarise it here.

  deb http://www.coker.com.au lenny selinux

  * To run a Squeeze kernel with Lenny policy you need to use the latest Lenny
    SE Linux policy from the above APT repository, install that and run
    "selinux-policy-upgrade" to apply it before booting the Lenny kernel.

  * If you run a Lenny kernel with Squeeze policy then you will get a large
    number of annoying kernel messages due to a minor kernel bug.  The
    command “dmesg -n 1” will prevent such messages from going to the system
    console, this is necessary for a usable console login.

  * To upgrade a system to the Squeeze policy you should run the following
    commands.  They must be run in single-user mode if SE Linux is a critical
    part of the system's security model but may be run from multi-user mode
    if your use of SE Linux is just to catch any attacks that get past Unix
    security.

  * There have been some major updates in the file contexts in this
    release, so a relabelling of the file system is recommended after this
    upgrade. Please install selinux-basics, touch /.autorelabel as root,
    and reboot.

  * When installing strict policy, the postinst does not check for the
    contents of /etc/selinux/config to see if SELINUXTYPE is set to
    refpolicy-strict or not.  Ideally, if config does not have SELINUXTYPE
    set to refpolicy-strict, the installer should be prompted to see if
    they want to change the policy type and relabel; this is not yet
    done.  Please ensure that the setting for  SELINUXTYPE in the
    configuration file /etc/selinux/config matches what you want it to
    be.
